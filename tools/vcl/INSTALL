To install VCL, simply copy the executable file into your path ;

e.g /usr/local/bin

If you are going to use gasp or gcc with vcl, make sure that they 
are installed and in your path.  Under win32, you will need a
package like cygwin (downloadable freely from the internet) to
use them, as they are not provided as part of the OS nor as part
of this package.
